I sent ohlc.pm to Benjamin Warfield (cpan/~bwarfield) as a patch
about a year ago.  He later told me that he gets millions of
patches, some that work, some that don't and that he doesn't
really have time to apply them all.  This is understandable.  He
also told me that making sure GD::Graph is stable on all 16,000
platforms is his number one goal.  Admirable.

He then pointed out that I didn't really need to wait on him... I
could just release a sub-module.  I don't know why that didn't
occur to me in the first place.  Doi.

Anyway, what is an OHLC graph?  Let the example speak for itself:

    https://voltar.org/PerlModules/ohlc_example.png

    (This is a mixed.pm graph.  The lines with ticks are the
    ohlc chart.  The ticks show the opening and closing
    prices of MSFT.  The line itself shows the high and
    low for the period.)
